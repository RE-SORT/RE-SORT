## Introduction

RE-SORT: A CTR prediction framework that removes spurious correlations in multilevel feature interactions, which leverages critical causal relationships between items and users in diverse nonlinear feature spaces to enhance the CTR prediction.

## Dependencies

RE-SORT has the following dependencies:

+ python 3.6+
+ pytorch 1.10+ 

## Quick Start

python run_expid.py --config {config_dir} --expid {experiment_id} --gpu {gpu_device_id}
